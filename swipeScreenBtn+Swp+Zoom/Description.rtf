\f0\fs24 \cf0 In this swipe screen I tried:\
1) swipe gesture: for the swiping of the image.\
2) swipe with buttons: previous / Next.\
3) Zooming the image: For this we have to place the scroll view and in that scroll view place the image view. And all other things are done by the code, also don\'92t forget to declare its delegate in .h file.}
